# dotfiles

These are the configuration files that I use in my main computer. I manage my dotfiles with [Homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/), a tool developed by [Anders Ingemann](https://github.com/andsens). In this repository I have configuration files for:

  - Bash.
  - Vim.
  - [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl).
  - [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3).
  - [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky).
  - [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).
  - Terminator.

If you want to use this dotfiles, you can follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick/wiki/Installation) and then run `homeshick clone ivanhercaz/dotfiles`.
